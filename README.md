### ABOUT ME

Hi there, I'm Hirotaka Takayama from Japan! 

I work in the semiconductor industry and have a passion for developing Android Apps and Python scripts in my free time 🌱

I enjoy learning new skills and languages, and currently, I'm focusing on improving my English and Taiwanese Mandarin (traditional Chinese) for business purposes.

Feel free to check out my repositories to see some of my projects. 

Also, hopefully, you are interested in trying to use my Android Apps below 😄

Developed Android Apps:
